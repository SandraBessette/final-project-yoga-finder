# Yoga finder with google map API and a private chat using MERN stack and socket-io

<p align="center"><img src="./Images/screen/mainMap.PNG"></p>

## Introduction

This is my final project for the Concordia web development bootcamp.
The Yoga Finder Project gives you the opportunity to search for yoga and meditation centers as well as yoga accessory stores in your area (in Canada). The map is the main tool of your search, you will see the position of the businesses you are looking for and a list of businesses sorted by proximity from a central location of your choice. You can use filters to refine your search.
The yoga centers can be rated and received comments and can be added to your favorites. You also have the option to chat with the owner and other users of the app.
If you are a owner of this type of business you can add it to the application.
\*\*\* All the businesses in the app have been added by me and not the real owner of the business as a demonstration purpuse only.
